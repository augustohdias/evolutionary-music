# Evolutionary Music
Music using EC concepts.


## Objectives
Generate pleasant melodies using the concepts of Evolutionary Computing and Musical Theory.

## What is done?
The model is able to generate a population and to cross between the best pairs.

## Need to be done
* Implement mutation;

* Improve the metrics for the evaluation of individuals, considering aspects such as scale change, tension and resolution;

* Improve the population format by adding time to the notes;

* Generation of melodies based on a chord progression.

## Further Projects
Apply supervised learning, aiming the abstraction of a particular musical style. The melody generation will be expanded to a full composition generation.
