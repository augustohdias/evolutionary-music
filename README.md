# Evolutionary Music
Music using EC concepts.


## Objectives
Gerar melodias agradáveis usando os conceitos de Computação Evolutiva e Teoria Musical.

## What is done?
The model is able to generate a population and to cross between the best pairs.

## Improves
* Improve the metrics for the evaluation of individuals, considering aspects such as scale change, tension and resolution;

* Improve the population format by adding time to the notes;

* Implement mutation.

## Future Projects
Supervised learning aiming at the abstraction of a particular musical style so that the evaluations of solution are better directed.
