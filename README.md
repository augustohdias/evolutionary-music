# Evolutionary Music
Music using EC concepts.


## Objectives
Generate pleasant melodies using the concepts of Evolutionary Computing and Musical Theory.

## What is done?
The model is able to generate a population and to cross between the best pairs.

## Need to be done
* Implement mutation;

* Improve the metrics for the evaluation of individuals, considering aspects such as scale change, tension and resolution;

* Improve the population format by adding time to the notes;

* Generation of melodies based on a chord progression.

## Future Projects
Supervised learning aiming at the abstraction of a particular musical style so that the evaluations of solution are better directed.
